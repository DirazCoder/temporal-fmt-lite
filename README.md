# temporal-fmt-lite

Format `Temporal.PlainDate` / `PlainTime` / `PlainDateTime` / `ZonedDateTime` objects
using date-fns-style token strings.

This is the small one. If you just want `format()` and `parse()` and
nothing else, this is a frozen, stripped-down snapshot of
[`temporal-fmt`](https://github.com/DirazCoder/temporal-fmt) — same two
functions, same locale support, same `setTemporal()` escape hatch, ~7x
smaller install, and no growth planned. See [Why this
exists](#why-this-exists) below.

Zero dependencies. Native on Node 26+, or bring your own via a polyfill or
`setTemporal()`.

Locale-aware tokens need Node 20+ regardless of which path you use — native
on 26+, or falling back to the Temporal implementation's own
`toLocaleString()` otherwise. Untested below Node 20.

## Install

```sh
npm install temporal-fmt-lite
```

## Providing `Temporal`

### Node 26+

Temporal is native and used automatically.

### Polyfill

Use a polyfill like [`temporal-polyfill`](https://github.com/fullcalendar/temporal-polyfill) to implement Temporal
in the global namespace.

```js
import 'temporal-polyfill/global'
import { format, parse } from 'temporal-fmt-lite';

parse(...);
```

### Bring Your Own

Set a Temporal implementation explicitly, once, before your app's first
`format()`/`parse()` call:

```js
import { Temporal } from 'temporal-polyfill/full';
import { setTemporal, format, parse } from 'temporal-fmt-lite';

setTemporal(Temporal); // once, before using `format` or `parse`.
```

`setTemporal()` takes precedence over native or global Temporal, and calling
it again overrides whatever was set before. Useful when you don't want to
pollute the global namespace, like for libraries.

## Usage

```js
import { format } from 'temporal-fmt-lite';

const date = Temporal.PlainDate.from('2026-08-04');
format(date, 'yyyy-MM-dd');           // "2026-08-04"
format(date, 'MMMM d, yyyy');         // "August 4, 2026"

const dt = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from('2026-08-04T15:45:30');
format(dt, "MMM d, yyyy 'at' h:mm a"); // "Aug 4, 2026 at 3:45 PM"

const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from('2026-08-04T15:45:30-04:00[America/New_York]');
format(zdt, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm zzz');   // "2026-08-04 15:45 America/New_York"
```

Wrap literal text in single quotes, like `'at'` above. Need an actual single
quote in your output? Use `''`.

## Parsing a string

`parse` builds a `Temporal.PlainDate` / `PlainTime` / `PlainDateTime` /
`ZonedDateTime` out of a string, picking whichever type fits the tokens
present:

```js
import { parse } from 'temporal-fmt-lite';

parse('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm', '2026-08-04 15:45');    // Temporal.PlainDateTime
parse('yyyy-MM', '2026-08-04T15:45:30');          // throws — shape doesn't match
parse('yyyy-MM-dd', '2026-02-30');                // throws — not a real date
```

Because the format is unknown at runtime you will need to check the result
with `instanceof`, or manually assert/type guard it in Typescript, to narrow the type.

Since `parse` constructs a real value rather than just matching shape, it
catches an impossible date like February 30th, or a weekday name that
doesn't match the date it's paired with:

```js
parse('EEEE, yyyy-MM-dd', 'Tuesday, 2026-08-04');  // fine — that really is a Tuesday
parse('EEEE, yyyy-MM-dd', 'Monday, 2026-08-04');   // throws — it isn't
```

`parse` throws when `input` doesn't match `formatStr`'s shape at all
or throws a descriptive error if the computed date is not valid.

A few things worth knowing:

- **`yy` (2-digit year)** emulates POSIX-style [strptime](https://www.man7.org/linux//man-pages/man3/strptime.3p.html): `00–68`
  becomes `2000–2068`, `69–99` becomes `1900–1999`.
  - this is an opinionated tradeoff but ensures `yy` is deterministic without an external date reference
- **`hh`/`h` (12-hour) without an `a` token throws** — same if a format string mixes `HH`/`H` with `hh`/`h`,
  even when both agree on the same hour. `parse` won't guess which one is authoritative; pick one.
- **`MMMM`/`MMM` name matching assumes a 12-month calendar** — the vocabulary
  it matches against is generated from 12 Gregorian reference dates, so a
  calendar with a leap month (e.g. Hebrew's 13-month leap years) isn't fully
  covered by month *names*. Numeric `yyyy-MM-dd` round-trips aren't affected.

## Locale support

Pass a BCP 47 locale tag as a third argument and month names, weekday names,
and AM/PM markers all localize accordingly. Defaults to `'en-US'` if you don't.

```js
format(date, 'MMMM d, yyyy', { locale: 'fr-FR' });   // "août 4, 2026"
format(date, 'EEEE d MMMM', { locale: 'ar-EG' });    // Arabic weekday/month names
format(dt, 'h:mm a', { locale: 'ja-JP' });            // "3:45 午後"
```

`a` matches AM/PM markers case-insensitively when parsing (`"pm"`, `"Pm"`,
and `"PM"` all work).

The named fields (`MMMM`, `MMM`, `EEEE`, `EEE`, `a`) go through
`Intl.DateTimeFormat` under the hood, which means non-Gregorian calendars
work too, as long as the `Temporal` object is already carrying one:

```js
const hebrewDate = date.withCalendar('hebrew');
format(hebrewDate, 'MMMM d, yyyy');   // "Av 21, 5786"
```

The above holds true for `parse` as well:

```js
parse('MMMM d, yyyy','août 4, 2026', { locale: 'fr-FR' });
parse('h:mm a', '3:45 午後', { locale: 'ja-JP' });
// `-u-ca-` calendar extension parses into that calendar
parse('yyyy-MM-dd', '5786-11-21', { locale: 'en-u-ca-hebrew' });
```

**Numeric fields (`yyyy`, `MM`, `dd`, `HH`, `mm`, `ss`, `SSS`) always come out
in Western (0-9) digits, no matter what locale you pass.** On purpose. Most
things reading this output back in — logs, APIs, filenames — want boring,
predictable ASCII digits, and locale-native numeral systems like Arabic-Indic
or Devanagari don't play nicely with this library's zero-padding logic anyway.
Need localized digits? Run the numeric pieces through `Intl.NumberFormat`
yourself.

| dd    | 2-digit day        | 04      |
| d     | day                | 4       |
| EEEE  | full weekday       | Tuesday |
| EEE   | short weekday      | Tue     |

This is the complete token list, and it isn't growing — see
[Why this exists](#why-this-exists). Try to use a token your input type
doesn't support — `HH` on a `PlainDate`, say — and you'll get a real error
telling you so, not a silent `undefined` sitting in your output waiting to
confuse someone in three weeks.

## Why this exists

`temporal-fmt` started small: `format()`, `parse()`, locale support, done.
Over time it grew a CLI, IDE tooling, a mod/plugin sandbox, business
calendars, holiday calendars, recurrence rules, a timezone subsystem, and
more — useful things individually, but the combination turned a ~200KB
install into a multi-megabyte one for people who only ever wanted to type
`'yyyy-MM-dd'` instead of learning `Intl.DateTimeFormat` options. See
[dirazcoder/temporal-fmt#9](https://github.com/DirazCoder/temporal-fmt/issues/9)
for the numbers.

`temporal-fmt-lite` is that original surface, pulled back out: the exact
`format()`/`parse()` API and behavior as of `temporal-fmt` v0.8.2, rebuilt
against the current, more correct internals (a few real bugs — a ReDoS in
certain glued-token format strings, a couple of parsing edge cases, an
unhelpful crash on `null` input — have been fixed underneath), with
everything added after v0.8.2 left out.

**What that means going forward:**

- No new tokens, no new exported functions, no new options. If it's not in
  this README, it's not going to quietly show up in a patch release.
- Only security and correctness fixes get backported — things that don't
  change what already-working code does, they just make broken edge cases
  behave the way the docs always said they would.
- No LTS guarantee. This is a small, deliberately-finished package, not an
  actively developed product. If you outgrow it — you need the CLI, IDE
  tooling, recurrence rules, business calendars, or any of the rest —
  `temporal-fmt` itself is the natural next step, and this package's API is
  a strict subset of that one's, so migrating is additive, not a rewrite.

## Known limitations

- Numeral systems are always Western digits — see [Locale support](#locale-support).
- Locale-aware tokens need Node 20+, native or polyfilled. Untested below Node 20.
- As mentioned above, you must [provide a Temporal implementation](#providing-temporal)
  if it is not natively provided (Node 26+)
- On engines with native `Temporal` support (Node 26+), locale-aware tokens
  (`MMMM`/`MMM`/`EEEE`/`EEE`) can render the wrong month or weekday for dates
  before around 1582 CE. This is a known ICU limitation, not a bug in this
  library: ICU's default Gregorian calendar cutover is October 15, 1582, so
  `Intl.DateTimeFormat.formatToParts()` silently reinterprets earlier dates
  under the Julian calendar, even though `Temporal` itself uses a proleptic
  Gregorian calendar throughout — see
  [tc39/ecma402#1003](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/1003). Numeric
  tokens (`yyyy`/`MM`/`dd`) never go through `Intl` and aren't affected.
- Gluing two unpadded numeric tokens with no separator between them (e.g.
  `Md`, `dM`, `Hm`) is ambiguous for some inputs, and `parse()` throws rather
  than guessing. `"121"` against `yyyy-Md` could mean month 1/day 21 or month
  12/day 1 — both are valid, so there's no single correct reading to fall
  back to. Unambiguous inputs against the same format string still parse
  normally (`"85"` against `yyyy-Md` only has one valid split). If you need
  glued numeric fields, either zero-pad them (`MM`/`dd`) or put a separator
  between them; that removes the ambiguity entirely.

  Note: `Md` (or `dM`/`Hm`) alone, with no `yyyy`, always throws —
  `parse()` requires year, month, and day together to build a date, so a
  bare `Md` format string is incomplete regardless of ambiguity. The
  examples above use `yyyy-Md` for exactly this reason.
- Format strings with many glued numeric tokens placed directly next to
  digit-consuming neighbors are rejected outright at parse-pattern build
  time (e.g. `'Md'.repeat(13)`) rather than compiled — this shape causes
  exponential regex backtracking on near-miss input in any implementation
  that doesn't specifically guard against it. Add a separator between
  tokens (or use their padded forms) and the format string works normally.
